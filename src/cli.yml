            By default, a commit with an unknown parent cannot be
            synchronized. This prevents mistakes and ensures the topology
            of the sync'ed repository is preserved.
            However, there are some legitimate cases when this situation can
            happen, for example when synchronizing a merge commit with
            one ancestor dating from prior to the bootstrap.
            In that case, we want to cherry-pick the commits brought by
            the merge (or in this context, "uproot" them).
            This behavior can be activated with this flag.

            Filter applied on the messages of copied commits.
            Lines in the commit message that matches the filter will not
            be copied in the message of the new commit.

            Can be a regular expression. On match, the whole line will
            be removed.
            Multiple filters can be specified.

            Examples:
                commit message:
                    brief

                    details
                    Refs: #15
                    Closes: #23

                $ ripit -C '^Refs' -C '^Closes'

                result:
                    brief
